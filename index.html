    <main>
        <p>
          Born and raised in the Greater Seattle Area. Studied Computer Science at Arizona State University. Currently writing software at <a href="https://nikolamotor.com/" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Nikola Motor Company</a> in Phoenix, AZ.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Nikola I am currently writing front-end software using modern JavaScript frameworks. I have developed proficiency in VueJS, React.js and Svelte during (and prior to) my time at Nikola. I care deeply about building and developing reliable, performant, web applications that create real value for users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Familiarity with contemporary software delivery processes has given me the ability to grow and lead my team to continuously deliver reliable software, on time with confidence; This has resulted in increased team velocity, appropriate test coverage and the flexibility to adapt quickly in production.
        </p>
        <p>
          I value opportunities to reason about loosely defined technical challenges and solutions. I have demonstrated a high capacity for navigating ambiguous problems and positively impacting business outcomes through innovation, effective organization, and overall execution of key projects. I value self sufficiency and time for independent problem solving, however, also enjoy team efforts and opportunities to collaborate within groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my wife and our dog-child, Sam. I am from the Pacific Northwest and very much enjoy some good coffee, water sports, hiking and the outdoors in general. In high school and college I played rugby competively, and have an Olympic Weightlifting coach certification.
