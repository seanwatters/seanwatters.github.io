      <h2 class="first_header_style_home">About</h2>
        <p class="first_text_style_home">Born and raised in Northwest Washington. I spent the last 6 years in Phoenix/Tempe, AZ. Happily back in Seattle, WA &mdash; studying software engineering at <a href="https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp/seattle/" style="color: black;">Flatiron School</a>. I have a very sweet golden lab pup, Sam and am engaged to my best friend, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/taylorbbigelow/" style="color: black;">Taylor</a>. I'm passionate about business ethics, consumer privacy and social justice.

      <h2 class="left_header_style">Back Story</h2>
        <p class="left_text_style">I grew up in <a href="https://twitter.com/CityofBhamWA" style="color: black;">Bellingham, WA</a> with my younger brother <a href="https://www.twitter.com/calebwatters" style="color: black;">Caleb</a>, parents &mdash; <a href="https://www.twitter.com/watters" style="color: black;">Cameron</a> and <a href="https://www.twitter.com/betsy" style="color: black;">Betsy</a> &mdash; and my first dog named Sam. Growing up with a young, 20 something-th-year-old software engineer, parent is just like it sounds... in seriousness, it was mostly great + really high intensity. For all that it was, Caleb and I are both pursuing careers in tech.

        My personal disposition has always been geared more toward the design side of things. Delivering a useful, beautiful product has always been important to me. Passion for drawing, painting, and art exploration in general started at a young age. I've been playing guitar since I was 7 years old and started exploring photography around the same time. Home movie news reels and stop motion with Lego were big parts of my childhood. Photo editing and graphic design came into play later down the road. In high school, I designed the new logo and jerseys for my high school rugby team. Most recently, I designed and built my website (this one).
